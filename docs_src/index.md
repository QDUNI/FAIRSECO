# How to Run

---

In your GitHub repository, put the following workflow code in a `.yml` file in the `.github/workflows` directory:

```yaml
name: RunFAIRSECO

on:
    # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
    workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  RunTortellini:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
            - uses: actions/checkout@v3
            - uses: tortellini-tools/action@v3
            - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
              with:
                  name: tortellini-result
                  path: .tortellini/out
  
  RunSBOM:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
            - uses: actions/checkout@v3
            - uses: anchore/sbom-action@v0
              with:
                  artifact-name: SBOM.spdx
  
  RunFAIRSECO:
        needs: [RunTortellini, RunSBOM]
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
            - uses: actions/checkout@v3
            - uses: actions/checkout@v3
              with:
                repository: QDUNI/FairSECO
                path: FAIRSECO_Assets
            - uses: QDUNI/FairSECO@main # this is the main action
              with:
                  myToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
            - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
              with:
                  name: FAIRSECO Result
                  path: .FAIRSECO/
            - name: Commit files
              run: |
                  git config --local user.email "github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"
                  git config --local user.name "github-actions[bot]"
                  git pull
                  git add -f ./.fairseco_history.json
                  git commit --allow-empty -m "Update FAIRSECO history file"
            - name: Push changes
              uses: ad-m/github-push-action@master
              with:
                  github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
                  branch: ${{ github.ref }}
```

The workflow creates an artifact in the `.FAIRSECO` directory that contains the following files:
- dashboard.html
    - Dashboard where you can see the results in a clear overview
- citationgraph.html
    - Graph view for citations in the dashboard
- report.yml
    - Contains the data collected and processed by the action
- program.log
    - The log of the program

The workflow also writes the `.fairseco_history.json` file to the repository. This file contains historical data used for the Impact History page in the dashboard.
