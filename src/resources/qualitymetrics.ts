 * #### FAIRness score
 * Score between 0 and 100 proportional to how many of the five FAIRness criteria are met.
 * #### Maintainability score
 * The percentage of closed GitHub issues.
 * #### License score
 * Score between 0 and 100 indicating how compatible the license of the project is with those of its dependencies. The more violations there are, the lower the license score will be.
 * #### Documentation
 * Score between 0 and 100, depending on the presence of a documentation directory and readme.md file.
 * #### Average Solve Time
 * Average number of days between opening and closing an issue. This number is not used to calculate the quality score, but may be displayed separately. This is because the acceptable amount of time it takes to solve an issue can be different for each project.
