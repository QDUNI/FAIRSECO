 * Selects papers that are likely a reference paper of the main paper given by its title.
 * The number of contributors should be at least the average of contributors of all papers given.
 * Probability is defined as the number of words that occur in both titles divided by the total number of words in the title of the main paper.

 * @param title The title of the main paper.
 * @param uniquePapers A map containing the ID and metadata of the papers.
 * @param probabilityThreshold The minimum probability a paper need to be counted as a reference paper.
 * 
 * @returns An array containing the keys of papers that are likely a reference paper.
