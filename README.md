# How to run

In your Github repository, put the following workflow code in a `.yml` file in the `.github/workflows` folder:

```yaml
name: RunFAIRSECO

on:
    # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
    workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
    RunFAIRSECO:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
            - uses: actions/checkout@v3
            - uses: tortellini-tools/action@v3
            - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
              with:
                  name: tortellini-result
                  path: .tortellini/out
            - uses: anchore/sbom-action@v0
              with:
                  artifact-name: SBOM.spdx # Output is in JSON format
            - uses: QDUNI/FAIRSECO@main
            - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
              with:
                  name: FAIRSECO Result
                  path: .FAIRSECO/
```

The workflow creates an artifact in the folder `.FAIRSECO` containing the following files:
- index.html
    - Dashboard where you can see the results in a nice overview
- Report.yml
    - Contains the data collected and processed by the action
- program.log
    - The log of the program
